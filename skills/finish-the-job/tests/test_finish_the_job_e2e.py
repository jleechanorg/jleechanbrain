"""End-to-end tests for the finish-the-job trigger surfaces and scenarios.

These tests assert that the three trigger surfaces (`/finish`, `/auto`, and the
literal phrase "finish the job") all route to the same end-state protocol,
and that the protocol's behavior can be exercised against (a) a dummy
dropped-Slack-thread scenario and (b) a dummy open-PR scenario, both
scripted end-to-end.

Layer 2 evidence: these tests do not mock the skill's contract. They read
the live SKILL.md, the live RESOLVER.md, and the live .claude/commands/
slash-command files in prod, then assert the trigger wiring is consistent
across all three layers.
