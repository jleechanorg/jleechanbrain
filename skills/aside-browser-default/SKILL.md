description: Aside browser is the PRIMARY browser tool for all Hermes/Claude/Codex work. Use aside CLI (repl/mcp/exec modes) or aside-mcp before Playwright MCP / superpowers-chrome. Use when opening browsers, scraping, UI tests, localhost verification, cookie injection flows, or any browser-driven automation. Playwright MCP and superpowers-chrome are explicit fallbacks for cases Aside can't handle (e.g., headless CI runners, Playwright-specific test fixtures). Reversible — see ~/.smartclaw/scripts/rollback-aside-default.sh.

# Aside Browser Default

## Contract

**Default: Aside first.** For all browser work, agents should reach for the Aside CLI / Aside MCP server before Playwright MCP or superpowers-chrome. Playwright MCP and superpowers-chrome are **named fallbacks** — preserved, not deleted — for cases Aside can't handle (rare; mostly headless CI runners and Playwright-specific test fixtures).

| Tool | Role | When to use |
|------|------|-------------|
| **`aside` CLI / `aside-mcp`** | **Primary** | Default for everything: UI tests, localhost verification, scraping, cookie flows, public-data lookups |
| `mcp__playwright-mcp` | Fallback | Only when Aside CLI is unavailable, or for Playwright-specific fixtures (trace viewer, `--isolated` profile mode, video recording) |
| `mcp__plugin-superpowers-chrome__chrome_use_browser` | Fallback | Only when Chrome-specific behavior is required (e.g., you need Chrome's exact `--user-data-dir` semantics for a particular test) |

**Explicit opt-in phrases only:** Jeffrey says *"show browser"*, *"headed mode"*, *"visible browser"*, or *"I want to see the window"* in the **current thread**. Aside supports both headed and headless modes; the agent picks based on the opt-in.

## Why Aside

Aside is a Y Combinator–backed AI-native Chromium browser launched June 2026. Advantages over the prior default:

- **AI-native design** — Aside's `aside "..."` NL agent and `--effort ultrabrowse` mode can plan + execute multi-step browser workflows without the agent writing Playwright scripts.
- **Same Chrome internals** — Aside is Chromium-based, so `document.querySelector`, CDP, computed styles, etc. all work identically.
- **Persistent browser session** — Aside runs as a long-lived daemon (`~/Library/Application Support/Aside/AsideDaemon/...`); opening 100 tabs across 100 agent calls doesn't spawn 100 browser processes.
- **MCP server first-class** — `aside mcp` exposes the browser over the standard MCP protocol, so any agent runtime that supports MCP (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, AO) can use it as a drop-in browser tool.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Before any browser action

1. **Check Aside is alive:** `aside account list` should show `* u0 jleechan@gmail.com  signed in  profiles: Profile 0`. If not, see "Aside is not running" below.
2. **For complex multi-step work** (scraping, public-data lookups, forms), prefer `aside "..."` NL agent with `--effort ultrabrowse`.
3. **For deterministic scripted work** (screenshot a URL, click a button, fill a form), prefer `aside repl "..."` with the Playwright-shaped API (`openTab`, `snapshot`, `listBrowserTabs`).
4. **For agent-runtime MCP tool exposure** (Claude Code/Codex tool calls), use `mcp__aside-mcp__*` if the runtime exposes it; otherwise drop to `aside repl` from a terminal tool call.
5. **Only if Aside is unavailable or inappropriate**, fall back to `mcp__playwright-mcp` (headless Chromium).

### Phase 2 — During automation

- **REPL pattern** (works in both `aside repl` and `aside mcp`):
  ```js
  const p = await openTab('https://example.com');
  const s = await snapshot(p, { interactive: true });
  console.log(s.tree);     // or s.title, s.url, s.childCount
  await closeTab(p);       // or closeAllTabs() at end
  ```
- **NL agent pattern** (best for "find X on this site" tasks):
  ```bash
  aside --effort ultrabrowse "Find the next available AirBnB near 1127 Riverside Drive that sleeps 4 and has AC, return the listing URL + price + availability dates"
  ```
- **Live tab list pattern** (when an Aside tab is already open):
  ```bash
  aside repl "listBrowserTabs().map(t => ({url: t.url(), title: t.title()}))"
  ```
- **Session continuity** (continue a prior NL session):
  ```bash
  aside --session <id> "Continue from where we left off"
  ```
- **Account switching** (rare; for multi-account flows):
  ```bash
  aside --account u1 "open https://example.com"
  ```

### Phase 3 — After session

- Close any tabs the agent opened if they're not useful for the user: `aside repl "closeAllTabs()"`.
- If you called any headed action (no opt-in required for Aside, but worth checking), end the turn by confirming the next agent session starts headless again.

## Aside is not running

If `aside account list` fails or shows no signed-in account:

```bash
# 1. Is the Aside GUI app open?
pgrep -lf "Aside.app" | head -3

# 2. If not, launch it (the daemon will auto-start)
open -a "/Applications/Aside.app"

# 3. Wait ~3 seconds, then verify
sleep 3 && aside account list
```

If `aside` CLI itself is missing:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://releases.aside.com/install.sh | bash
```

## Anti-patterns (BANNED)

- ❌ Calling `mcp__playwright-mcp__*` as a first resort without checking Aside first
- ❌ Calling `show_browser` / headed mode without explicit opt-in (Aside supports both, but the headless-only default still applies)
- ❌ Spawning a fresh Playwright Chromium per agent call (Aside's persistent daemon is faster + more stateful)
- ❌ Using `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` for any browser work (requires extension, fails headless/CI)
- ❌ Copying cookies between browsers without re-encrypting under the target's Safe Storage key
- ❌ Assuming Aside CLI can read Chrome/Comet/Arc history (separate cookie stores)

## Path / tool availability matrix (as of 2026-06-27)

| Component | Path / URL | Verified? |
|---|---|---|
| Aside GUI app | `/Applications/Aside.app` | ✅ |
| Aside CLI binary | `${HOME}/.local/bin/aside` → `~/.aside/cli/Aside CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/aside` | ✅ |
| Aside CLI version | `1.26.626.1517` | ✅ |
| Aside daemon | `~/Library/Application Support/Aside/AsideDaemon/mac-arm64/1.26.627.1553/Aside Daemon.app` | ✅ |
| Aside account | `* u0 jleechan@gmail.com` Google provider, `Profile 0` | ✅ |
| Aside MCP (HTTP) | `http://127.0.0.1:8013/mcp` | ✅ (in `~/.claude/mcp-strict.json` + `~/.claude.json`) |
| Aside MCP (stdio) | `aside mcp` | ✅ |
| Aside Safe Storage keychain | `Aside Safe Storage` / `Aside` | ✅ |
| Aside cookie DB | `~/Library/Application Support/Aside/Default/Cookies` | ✅ |

## Cross-browser cookie portability

Aside uses its own macOS Keychain entry (`Aside Safe Storage`), separate from Chrome's (`Chrome Safe Storage`). Cookies cannot be cross-imported without re-encryption. The `browserclaw` skill now supports `--keychain-service 'Aside Safe Storage'` and `--keychain-account 'Aside'` for Aside → Playwright inject. The reverse direction (Chrome → Aside) is not supported in `browserclaw` yet — log a request via `/learn` if needed.

## Verification

```bash
# 1. CLI alive
aside --version       # 1.26.626.1517
aside account list    # * u0  jleechan@gmail.com  signed in

# 2. REPL alive
aside repl "console.log('ok')"        # [ok | <Nms>]
aside repl "listBrowserTabs().length" # a number (0 if no tabs open)

# 3. NL agent alive
aside "Open https://example.com and report the title"  # returns "Example Domain"

# 4. MCP server reachable
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8013/mcp -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | head -5
```

## Output format

When reporting browser work, include `browser_mode: aside-cli` (or `aside-mcp` / `playwright-fallback` / `superpowers-chrome-fallback`) in the status line.

## Reversal

To switch back to Playwright MCP as the default:

```bash
bash ~/.smartclaw/scripts/rollback-aside-default.sh
```

This script:
1. Saves a snapshot of the current `~/.claude.json` mcpServers block to `~/.smartclaw/snapshots/pre-aside-default-YYYY-MM-DD.json`.
2. Removes the `aside-browser-default` skill folder.
3. Removes `aside-mcp` from `~/.claude.json`.
4. Reverts SOUL.md / AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md browser COMMIT blocks to their pre-aside-default state (the blocks are read from the snapshot).
5. Resets macOS default browser to Chrome via `defaultbrowser chrome`.

The script is idempotent — running it twice is safe.
