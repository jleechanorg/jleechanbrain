description: Diagnose why a Slack reply "didn't go to the right thread" — covers FIVE known failure modes (gateway self-threaded post, runtime tool-surface gap, gateway scratch-leak during probing, tool-call narration leak, AND wrong-thread_ts from a stale session context header) and the durable direct-HTTP fallback path. Use when a Slack reply lands as a top-level channel message instead of a thread reply, when the bot's thinking trace leaks into the wrong thread, when mcp__slack__conversations_add_message is missing from the runtime tool list, when the session context header reports a thread_ts that turns out not to be the user's actual thread, or when the user says "I thought we fixed this?" / "isn't this patched?". NOTE: the `send_message` thread_ts-drop bug (Failure 1) was FIXED by hermes-agent PR #29 on 2026-06-14 — see the STATUS UPDATE banner; the still-open mode is Failure 5 (wrong thread_ts in the session context header).

# Slack Thread Routing — Investigation & Durable Post Path

> ## ⚠️ STATUS UPDATE — 2026-06-14: the `send_message` thread_ts-drop bug is FIXED
>
> **As of [PR #29](https://github.com/jleechanorg/hermes-agent/pull/29) (hermes-agent, merged 2026-06-14 21:57:32Z), the gateway `send_message` Slack path honors the `:thread_ts` segment of a 3-part `target="slack:CHAN:thread_ts"`.** Failure 1 (gateway self-roots / strips `:thread_ts` and falls back to the home channel — tracked as `jleechan-kr3b` / agent-orchestrator #684) is **resolved at the code level**: `tools/send_message_tool.py` now widens `_SLACK_TARGET_RE` to capture `:thread_ts`, forwards it in `_parse_target_ref`, builds the payload with it in `_send_slack`, and **fails loud** if the echoed `thread_ts` does not match.
>
> **What this means for you, right now:**
> - **Use the 3-part `send_message target="slack:CHAN:thread_ts"` form as the PRIMARY path.** It threads correctly post-#29.
> - **Path A (MCP HTTP-direct) and Path B (curl `chat.postMessage`) are now FALLBACKS**, not the default — use them only if the gateway tool is unavailable or you observe a *fresh* misroute.
> - **Every "`send_message` is BROKEN / never trust it / both forms land top-level / 11 instances" statement below is HISTORICAL (all dated 2026-06-09 → 2026-06-13, pre-#29).** It is retained as the investigation record, not as current guidance. Do **not** act on it as if `send_message` is still broken.
> - **Do NOT normalize root/sibling posts as "irreducible."** Post-#29 a clean single threaded reply is achievable. If your reply still lands at channel root, it is one of: (a) **Failure 5** below (a *wrong* `thread_ts` in your session context — run step 0), or (b) a *fresh* regression of the now-fixed path — in which case **file it** (don't accept it).
>
> **Still open (NOT fixed by #29):** **Failure 5 — wrong `thread_ts` injected by the session context header.** This is a separate session-routing bug, not a `send_message` bug. **Step 0 (verify `thread_ts` via `conversations_history`, never the header) remains mandatory regardless of which post path you use.**

## When to use this skill

Use when ANY of these are true:

1. A Slack reply landed as a top-level channel message instead of a thread reply (the user says "you posted in the wrong thread" or `conversations_replies` shows the new message has `thread_ts == ts`).
2. `mcp__slack__conversations_add_message` is not surfaced in the runtime's tool list, but the MCP server at `127.0.0.1:8006` does register it.
3. Bot debug/thinking lines are leaking into a sibling thread while you're trying to post a single user-facing reply.
4. The gateway `send_message` Slack path silently ignores `thread_ts` (or rewrites it to the outgoing post's own `ts`).
5. The user says "we thought we fixed this" / "isn't this fixed already?" / "I thought we patched this". As of 2026-06-14 the `send_message` thread_ts-drop bug **was** patched (PR #29 — see banner), so this signal no longer means "the send_message bug is still alive." It now most likely means either (a) **Failure 5** (the session context header is feeding you a wrong `thread_ts` — run step 0), or (b) an agent is still following the *historical* "never trust send_message" guidance below and self-rooting unnecessarily. Diagnose which before reaching for a workaround; only file a fresh gateway bead+GH issue if you reproduce a genuine post-#29 `send_message` misroute.

## Framing (updated 2026-06-14): the gateway routing bug WAS patched; one related mode remains

The `send_message` thread_ts-drop bug (Failure 1) was a genuine gateway-side bug in `jleechanorg/agent-orchestrator`'s Slack handler — it silently stripped the `:thread_ts` segment from `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts` and fell back to the home channel. **That bug is now fixed at the code level by [hermes-agent PR #29](https://github.com/jleechanorg/hermes-agent/pull/29) (merged 2026-06-14).** The `slack-reply-inherit-thread-ts` SOUL rule (2026-06-09) and the Path A/B curl workarounds in this skill were the *interim* agent-side mitigation; post-#29 they are fallbacks, not the default.

**One related mode is NOT a `send_message` bug and remains open: Failure 5** — the session-routing layer can inject a *wrong* `thread_ts` into your prompt's `Source: Slack (...)` header. No `send_message` fix addresses this, because the agent itself supplies the wrong target. **Step 0 (verify `thread_ts` from `conversations_history`, never the header) is the durable mitigation and is mandatory on every Slack reply.**

When a user signals they've seen this before ("we thought we fixed this?"): do **not** silently reach for a curl workaround or self-root. First determine which mode you're in — a *fresh* post-#29 `send_message` misroute (file a new gateway bead+issue, it would be a regression) vs Failure 5 (run step 0) vs an agent blindly following the historical "never trust send_message" guidance below (it's stale — use the now-fixed 3-part form).

## Action plan (the only durable cure)

If you are about to send a Slack reply that **must** land in a specific thread, follow these FIVE steps in this exact order — do not improvise:

0. **Verify the `thread_ts` from `conversations_history`, NOT from the session context header.** The header line `Source: Slack (group: <chan>, thread: <ts>)` is a hint, not authoritative. It can be stale, point to a HERMES-bot's prior self-message in the same channel (which has no replies and is not a thread), or point to a different user's thread. Before composing anything: call `mcp__slack__conversations_history(channel_id=<chan>, limit=5)`, find the user's most recent message in the channel, and use ITS `thread_ts` (or, if top-level, ITS `ts`) as the reply target. **This is Failure 5's mitigation** (see below). One `conversations_history` call is cheap; the cost of getting `thread_ts` wrong is 2 orphan posts in channel root + a self-correction reply. Verified universal across the 2026-06-14 instance 15.
1. **Compose the entire final reply in your head (or in a scratch buffer) before the first `send_message` call.** No interim "wait" / "let me re-check" / "actually" narration. The gateway serializes every `<think>` block and every post-`send_message` tool call as a separate `chat.postMessage`.
2. **Post the reply, in priority order:**
   - **PRIMARY (post-#29):** `send_message target="slack:CHAN:thread_ts"` (the 3-part form). Since PR #29 this honors `:thread_ts` and threads correctly — it is the simplest one-call path. (The historical "both forms land top-level / 11 instances" warning below is **pre-#29** and no longer applies to the 3-part form.)
   - **FALLBACK:** raw HTTP `chat.postMessage` (Path B): one curl call, JSON body via heredoc, explicit `channel` + `thread_ts` + `text`, bot token from `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`. Use this if the gateway tool is unavailable or you observe a fresh misroute. Either way: one post, no probing, no retrying with different `target` formats — each retry adds a leaked post.
3. **Compose the entire final reply before the first post call.** No interim "wait" / "let me re-check" / "actually" narration between post-related tool calls — the gateway serializes every `<think>` block and post-call tool result as its own `chat.postMessage` (Failure 4). This is the real lever against sibling-post leaks, independent of which post path you choose.
4. **Verify last.** `mcp__slack__conversations_replies channel_id=<chan> thread_ts=<ts>` is the final action of the turn — pass criteria: the new `MsgID` has `ThreadTs == <ts>` (not its own `MsgID`, not empty).

A clean single threaded reply is the expected outcome post-#29 — do **not** treat root/sibling posts as "irreducible cost." If your reply still leaks siblings, that's Failure 4 (collapse the investigation to ≤ 3 tool calls and compose before posting); if it lands at channel root, that's Failure 5 (wrong `thread_ts` — run step 0) or a fresh regression to file. The 10-post instance (2026-06-12, pre-#29) was caused by 15 tool calls between the first post and the recovery — tool-call discipline is the lever.

## Five known failure modes

### Failure 1 — Gateway self-roots the post (canonical bug, 2026-06-09 → FIXED 2026-06-14 by PR #29)

**Symptom:** the reply becomes a new top-level channel message; subsequent user follow-ups appear threaded to the bot's broken message, not the original.

**Root cause:** the gateway's Slack post path set `thread_ts = ts` of the *outgoing* post rather than the *incoming* message's `thread_ts` — it dropped the `:thread_ts` segment of the 3-part target and fell back to the home channel.

**Diagnostic:**
```bash
gh curl /api/... # or use mcp__slack__conversations_replies to compare ts vs thread_ts
```
On the broken message: `ThreadTs == MsgID` (self-rooted). On a correct message in the same channel: `ThreadTs` points to the original parent.

**Status — FIXED:** [hermes-agent PR #29](https://github.com/jleechanorg/hermes-agent/pull/29) (merged 2026-06-14 21:57:32Z) patched this at the code level in `tools/send_message_tool.py` (`_SLACK_TARGET_RE` widened, `_parse_target_ref`/`_send_slack` forward `thread_ts`, fail-loud on echo mismatch). The 3-part `send_message target="slack:CHAN:thread_ts"` form is now the PRIMARY working path. If you still see `ThreadTs == MsgID` on a post made via the 3-part form **after** #29, that is a *regression* — file a fresh gateway bead+GH issue (don't just work around it). Path A/B remain as fallbacks. (Failure 5 below — a *wrong* `thread_ts` from the session header — is a separate, still-open mode that #29 does not address.)

### Failure 2 — Runtime tool-surface gap (canonical bug, 2026-06-09)

**Symptom:** `mcp__slack__conversations_add_message` is missing from your tool list, even though the server registers 13 tools including it.

**Root cause:** the gateway's MCP client registers the tools server-side but does not surface `conversations_add_message` to the agent runtime. The other tools (`conversations_history`, `conversations_replies`, `channels_list`, `users_search`, etc.) ARE surfaced.

**Diagnostic:**
```bash
# Probe the server directly — initialize a session, list tools
SID=$(curl -sS -i -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8006/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"0"}}}' \
  | grep -i "^mcp-session-id:" | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\r')

curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8006/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SID" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}'
```
If `conversations_add_message` is in the response but missing from your tool list, you have Failure 2. Fall through to the Durable Post Path.

### Failure 3 — Gateway scratch-leak during probing (canonical bug, 2026-06-10)

**Symptom:** while figuring out the post endpoint (probing `/tools/list`, `/v1/tools`, `/mcp` without a session, etc.), 3-6 bot debug lines leak into the *most recent visible thread* in the channel — typically the broken sibling thread, which makes the leak loudest.

**Root cause:** the gateway times out the Slack post call after ~3 min and starts streaming intermediate status into whatever thread the user is looking at. This is the same gateway-scratch-leak from the 2026-06-09 loop, but the trigger changed: now any non-trivial post path investigation triggers it.

**Mitigation:** once you have a working `SID` from Failure 2's diagnostic, do all subsequent calls inside a single curl pipeline. Do NOT issue multiple curl calls separated by `echo "---"`. Each one is a fresh gateway invocation that risks another scratch-leak cycle.

### Failure 4 — Tool-call narration leaks as separate posts even after the final reply is correctly routed (canonical bug, 2026-06-11)

**Symptom:** the final user-facing reply lands correctly in-thread (verified via `conversations_replies`, `ThreadTs == original thread_ts`). But 3-7 sibling posts in the same thread are raw tool-call narration — phrases like "Let me check…", "Now I have the full picture…", "Two more scratch-leak posts in the thread — the runtime is leaking every tool-call narration", "Let me post ONE final cleanup note…". The narration comes from the runtime's `<think>` / tool-result summary that gets streamed as its own Slack message *after* the final reply's `send_message` returns.

**Root cause:** the gateway serializes each "text" block the runtime emits between tool calls as a separate `chat.postMessage`. The final `send_message` call succeeds, but the runtime keeps generating thinking-block text for subsequent tool calls (e.g. `mcp__slack__conversations_replies` to verify, `read_file` to check a status, etc.) and each one of those becomes a new Slack post. This is a different leak vector than Failure 1 (self-threaded) or Failure 3 (probing): the post is correctly threaded, it's just that there's a *flood* of them, one per `think` block.

**Diagnostic:** after sending a Slack reply, if you call `mcp__slack__conversations_replies` for verification and see N>1 new `MsgID` rows where all but one are short narration text, you have Failure 4. The `ThreadTs` of every leaked post matches the original thread's `thread_ts` (correctly routed), so it's NOT Failure 1.

**Mitigation:**
1. **Compose the entire final reply before calling `send_message` the first time.** Do not call `send_message`, then verify, then write more text — each verification step generates more narration that leaks. Verify AFTER the final reply only, and accept that 1-2 leaks of meta-reasoning may slip in.
2. **If 5+ narration posts already leaked, post ONE explicit cleanup message** in the same thread naming the noise (e.g. "the previous N posts were tool-call narration; the actionable reply is at ts X.Y") and stop. Do not delete them — there is no `chat.delete` token in the runtime in the typical case (verified 2026-06-11: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is not in the runtime's env, so the curl `chat.delete` path requires sourcing the token from the launchd plist, which is brittle).
3. **The actual post landed correctly; the user can see the answer.** Failure 4 is noise, not data loss. Don't let it derail into a "fix the leak" rabbit hole when the original request is still actionable.

**This is the failure mode that triggers the "2-part `target=slack:CHAN` works but pollutes the thread" observation from 2026-06-10 vNU3 PCD-spread (instance 5).** The 2-part form is the working pattern; the leak is a separate runtime-streaming bug, not a routing bug.

### Failure 5 — Wrong `thread_ts` from session context header (canonical bug, 2026-06-14, instance 15)

**Symptom:** the agent posts via Path B curl with what it believes is the correct `thread_ts` (taken from the runtime's `Source: Slack (group: <chan>, thread: <ts>)` context header). The post lands as 1-2 top-level orphans in the channel root with no `ThreadTs`, NOT in the intended thread. A `conversations_replies(thread_ts=<wrong_ts>)` call returns `thread_not_found` because the supposed "thread" is actually a HERMES-bot's prior top-level status post (not a thread) or a different user's question.

**Root cause:** the session-routing layer that injects `Source: Slack (group: <chan>, thread: <ts>)` into the prompt is not always in sync with the user's actual current thread. Three observed failure shapes:
- The header points to a HERMES-bot's own self-message in the same channel (the bot's prior status post, which is a top-level message with no replies, not a thread). `conversations_replies(ts=<bot_self_msg>)` returns `thread_not_found` because there is no parent.
- The header points to a different user's question from a different thread in the same channel. The agent posts to the wrong thread, polluting an unrelated conversation.
- The header is from a previous turn in the same session and points to a thread the user has already left. The post goes to a stale thread that the user is no longer reading.

**Diagnostic:**
```bash
# 1) Get the most recent messages in the channel
mcp__slack__conversations_history(channel_id=<chan>, limit=5)

# 2) Look for the user's question that triggered THIS turn
#    (not a HERMES-bot self-message, not a previous user's thread)
#    The user's question is a row with UserName=jleechan (or whoever)
#    and ThreadTs matching the actual thread the user is in

# 3) Use THAT row's ts (or thread_ts if it's a reply) as the reply target
#    NOT the thread_ts from the session context header
```

**Mitigation:** the pre-flight `conversations_history` step is now **required** before composing any Path B JSON payload. Treat the session context header as a hint about the channel (the `group` field is usually right), but never trust the `thread` field. The 1 extra tool call is cheap insurance against a 2-orphan + self-correction cycle. The corrected reply should include a `Self-correction transparency` section in its body (not a separate apology message) so the user reads one message with both the analysis AND the explanation of why prior siblings in the same turn were orphans. Worked example at `references/2026-06-14-wrong-thread-ts-context-instance-15.md`.

**Distinct from Failure 1:** Failure 1 is the gateway stripping `:thread_ts` from `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts`. Failure 5 is the agent itself supplying the wrong `thread_ts` from a stale prompt header. The post is correctly threaded under the wrong thread (or top-level if the wrong `thread_ts` does not exist as a thread) — it is not the gateway that mis-routes, it is the agent's input. Path A/B curl with the wrong `thread_ts` will reproduce the bug every time, deterministically. The fix is the agent's pre-flight, not the gateway.

**Implication for the gateway patch (#684):** even after `send_message` is fixed to honor `:thread_ts`, Failure 5 will still occur if the agent's session context header is stale. The session-routing layer that injects the thread context is a separate system from the gateway's Slack post path. Future agents should be aware that the "fix the gateway" PR does not eliminate Failure 5.

### Failure 5e — gateway-cron-LLM with `deliver: local` posts conversational narration at channel root (canonical bug, 2026-06-18, ts 1781793603)

**Symptom:** a cron job whose `deliver` field is `local` (no Slack `chat.postMessage` target is wired into the job itself) runs the LLM, and the LLM posts its conversational narration — clarifications ("just want to confirm: ..."), status updates ("phase complete on ..."), spawn announcements ("worker spawned for ...") — at channel root instead of the cron job's origin thread. Observed instance: 3 channel-root orphans at ts `1781793603.149289`, `1781793611.471479`, `1781793618.797789` in #worldai (`C0AH3RY3DK6`) from the `babysit-wa-2366-rev-5deak` cron job. All 3 posts reference both `PR #7570` and `wa-2366 / rev-5deak`; all 3 should have been threaded under `C0AH3RY3DK6 / 1781477039.080969` (the job's `thread_ts`).

**Root cause:** `deliver: local` means "do not call Slack from this job — the LLM is expected to surface its own output through whatever path the operator wired." When the LLM posts via Path C (`gateway send_message`), the 3-part `target="slack:CHAN:thread_ts"` form is required to thread correctly. Many cron prompts *do* include the channel + thread in the prompt body (e.g., "the deliver target is C0AH3RY3DK6 / thread 1781477039.080969"), but the LLM often paraphrases or skips the `thread_ts` segment when composing conversational posts, producing a root post. The gateway's Path C is technically correct (no 5a/5b path bug here); the bug is that the LLM narration thread inheritance is non-deterministic.

**Detection signature (5e-specific):**
- Channel-root post (`thread_ts` absent OR equal to `ts`)
- Author == hermes bot (`U0AEZC7RX1Q`)
- Text contains the cron job name (full or any hyphen-delimited part of length ≥ 4)
- Text contains at least one PR/thread identifier extracted from the job's prompt (regex: `PR #NNN`, `rev-XXXX`, `wa-NNNN`, generic `aa-NNNN` bead keys, or `NNNNNNNNNN.NNNNNN` Slack ts)
- Parent job in `~/.smartclaw_prod/cron/jobs.json` has `deliver: local`

**Fix layers (defense-in-depth):**
1. **Prompt guard** — cron prompts SHOULD repeat the channel + thread in plain text near the top of the prompt (already done for `babysit-wa-2366-rev-5deak`) AND instruct the LLM explicitly: "every Slack post MUST use `target=slack:C0AH3RY3DK6:1781477039.080969` form, not the bare channel form." The CONTEXT-DRIFT GUARD header pattern is the template.
2. **Detector** — `scripts/slack_5b_leak_detector.sh detect_5e_local_deliver_leaks` scans each `deliver: local` job's channel history, applies the signature above, and emits `5E-ALERT ts=<ts> channel=<C> job=<name> matched_id=<id> preview=<text>` lines. Hooked into the combined `detect_all_leaks` runner so a single cron invocation catches both 5b and 5e.
3. **Gateway enforcement** — `send_message_tool.py` (already fixed by PR #29 for 5a) should also reject 3-part targets whose `thread_ts` segment equals `0` or is empty when the calling session has a stored `origin_thread_ts` (deferred; tracked as `jleechan-5e-enforce`).

**Escape hatch:** cron jobs that *want* to opt out (e.g., LLM is supposed to start a fresh daily-thread anchor post) can set `"disable_5e_detect": true` in `jobs.json`. This mirrors the per-job override pattern used by other safety nets.

**Test coverage:** `tests/test_slack_5e_local_deliver_leak.sh` — 4 cases:
- (A) function defined
- (B) 3 leak ts detected, threaded reply + human + non-matching cron-name ignored
- (C) dedup — second run on same state file exits 0
- (D) `disable_5e_detect: true` escape hatch honored

**Sibling to:** Failure 5 (wrong `thread_ts` from session context header — agent pulls stale thread from the prompt), 5b (MCP-direct Claude Code posts bypass gateway), 5c (intentional first-of-day daily-anchor is by design channel-root), 5d (cron LLM content drift — right channel/thread, wrong PR). 5e is distinct: right content, wrong routing layer (cron job's path), post lands at channel root because `deliver: local` lets the LLM pick the post shape.

**Defense-in-depth gaps remaining:** (i) the gateway Path C tool does not auto-inject the cron job's `thread_ts` when `deliver: local` is detected — would require a new `origin_thread_ts` runtime context, tracked separately; (ii) no automated re-thread on alert — operator must manually `chat.update` to set `thread_ts` on the orphan post; (iii) detector reads `jobs.json` from disk per run, so a job that runs >once/2h can miss leaks if the operator rotates `jobs.json` mid-window (acceptable for the cron cadence in use today).

## Durable Post Path (3 paths in priority order)

> **Post-#29 priority (2026-06-14):** the primary path is now **Path C (gateway `send_message` 3-part `target="slack:CHAN:thread_ts"`)** — see the Path C section below. Path A and Path B are **fallbacks** for when the gateway tool is unavailable or a fresh misroute is observed. The "Path A preferred since 2026-06-09" note below reflects the pre-#29 era when `send_message` was broken.

### Path A — Slack MCP HTTP-direct (fallback; was preferred 2026-06-09 → pre-#29)

```bash
# 1) Initialize session, capture Mcp-Session-Id from response header
SID=$(curl -sS -i -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8006/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"0"}}}' \
  | grep -i "^mcp-session-id:" | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\r')

# 2) Send notifications/initialized (HTTP 202 expected, no body)
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8006/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SID" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}' \
  -o /dev/null

# 3) Post the message — INHERIT thread_ts from the incoming message
python3 -c "
import json
print(json.dumps({
  'jsonrpc':'2.0','id':3,
  'method':'tools/call',
  'params':{
    'name':'conversations_add_message',
    'arguments':{
      'channel_id':'C0XXXXXXXX',
      'thread_ts':'1234567890.123456',  # ← INHERIT from incoming, NOT the outgoing post's ts
      'content_type':'text/plain',      # avoids Block Kit fragmentation
      'text': '...'
    }
  }
}))
" > /tmp/post.json

curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8006/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SID" \
  --data-binary @/tmp/post.json
```

The MCP response returns a CSV header line, NOT the message ID. To confirm the post landed, use `mcp__slack__conversations_replies` and look for the new `MsgID` at the bottom.

**CRITICAL: `thread_ts` must be the INCOMING message's `thread_ts`.** If the incoming message has no `thread_ts` (top-level), use the incoming message's own `ts`. This is enforced by SOUL rule `COMMIT: slack-reply-inherit-thread-ts`.

### Path B — chat.postMessage with bot token (escape hatch)

When the MCP server is down or refusing connections. Use `mrkdwn=False` to get plain text without Block Kit fragmentation:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -d '{
    "channel":"C0XXXXXXXX",
    "thread_ts":"1234567890.123456",
    "mrkdwn":false,
    "text":"..."
  }'
```

`content_type` for the MCP layer accepts both `text/markdown` and `text/plain` (verified 2026-06-10, despite the schema's documented enum of `text/markdown` only). Use `text/plain` for user-facing posts that contain emoji shortcodes or formatting that fragments in Block Kit — the 2026-06-09 "formatting broken" complaint was caused by `text/markdown` going through Block Kit `rich_text` parsing. The `chat.postMessage` fallback with `mrkdwn=False` (Path B) is only needed if you specifically want a real `ts` in the API response (the MCP path returns a CSV header instead).

### Path C — gateway `send_message` 3-part form (PRIMARY since PR #29, 2026-06-14)

**This is now the recommended primary path** for threaded replies. The historical breakage below predates the fix.

- **3-part form** `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts` — **WORKS as of [PR #29](https://github.com/jleechanorg/hermes-agent/pull/29) (2026-06-14).** The gateway now honors `:thread_ts` and fails loud on mismatch. Use this as the default one-call path. *(Pre-#29 history: silently stripped `:thread_ts` and landed in the home channel — Failure 1, the bug #29 fixed.)*
- **2-part form** `target=slack:CHAN` (no `:thread_ts`) — still **non-deterministic** for thread inheritance (*sometimes* threads, *sometimes* lands as a top-level orphan). Do not rely on it; always pass the explicit 3-part `:thread_ts`.

**Recommended order:** (1) `send_message` 3-part `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts` (primary, post-#29), (2) Path A (MCP HTTP-direct), (3) Path B (curl `chat.postMessage` with bot token) — fall to A/B only if the gateway tool is unavailable or you observe a *fresh* misroute. Always verify with `conversations_replies`; if a 3-part post self-roots after #29, treat it as a regression and file it.

**Pre-#29 verification record:** "broken across 11 instances (2026-06-09 → 2026-06-13)" — historical, applied before the fix. Retained as the investigation record, not current guidance.

## Verifying a post landed correctly

```python
# mcp__slack__conversations_replies with the ORIGINAL thread_ts
# The new message should appear at the bottom with ThreadTs == original thread_ts
```

**Pass criteria:** new `MsgID` row has `ThreadTs` matching the original thread's `thread_ts`.

**Fail criteria:** new `MsgID` row has `ThreadTs` equal to its own `MsgID` (self-rooted) — post-#29 this means either (a) Failure 5 (you posted with a *wrong* `thread_ts` from the session header — run step 0), or (b) a regression of the now-fixed `send_message` path (file a fresh gateway bead+GH issue). Pre-#29 it meant Failure 1 / the gateway thread_ts-drop bug, which PR #29 has since fixed.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Do NOT spawn an agent session just to read/post Slack. Use Slack MCP tools directly or Path A.
- Do NOT call `mcp__slack__conversations_add_message` from runtime that doesn't surface it (Failure 2). The tool call will fail with a "tool not found" error; the gateway may then leak scratch while retrying.
- Do NOT post plain text and then follow up with formatting. Pick `text/plain` (Path A or B) for the entire thread, or `text/markdown` (Path A only). Mixing causes Block Kit fragmentation.
- Do NOT issue multiple curl calls separated by `echo "---"` or interactive commentary while probing. Each call risks Failure 3.
- Do NOT trust the gateway's `deliver=slack:chat_id` cron format for threaded delivery. Use `deliver=slack:chat_id:thread_ts` instead. The thread_id segment is what carries `thread_ts` into the cron job's outgoing post.

## Support files

- `scripts/slack_mcp_post.sh` — copy-pasteable bash script that bakes in the three lessons from this skill: (1) capture SID in one curl call, do not probe, (2) inherit `thread_ts` from the incoming message, (3) the MCP response is a CSV header, not a JSON-RPC result. Use this instead of hand-typing the curl pipeline each time. Args: `<channel_id> <thread_ts> <text-file>`. Exit 0 = post accepted by MCP, but you must still verify with `conversations_replies`.
- `references/2026-06-10-repro-vNU3-pcd-spread-instance-5.md` — 5th confirmed instance of the 3-part form mis-route. Worked example of a 2-part `target=slack:CHAN` recovery (no thread_ts) that happened to work, but with 3-4 leaked meta-reasoning messages as collateral. The 2nd-derivative lesson: do not retry send_message with different target formats once you see the home-channel fallback — switch to curl on the second attempt, not the third.
- `references/2026-06-10-wa-2289-godmode-l6-instance-4.md` — 4th confirmed instance of the 3-part form mis-route (this session). Worked example of a clean Path B recovery with no scratch-leak. Read this if you want the "smallest possible clean recovery" recipe; read `references/2026-06-10-dropped-thread-followup.md` for the more chaotic instances with scratch-leaks.
- `references/2026-06-13-stale-fix-callback-instance-11.md` — 11th confirmed instance and **first time the user explicitly invoked a prior fix as an expectation of resolution** ("We shouldn't be replying here I thought we fixed the issue?"). Documents the recovery recipe (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` sourced from `~/.bashrc`, not runtime env) and the two micro-lessons embedded: (1) `gh issue create --label` does NOT validate label existence — always `gh label list` first; (2) `br comments add <id> "text"` uses positional args, not `--body`. Read this when the user signals "I thought this was fixed" — the next action is **file a bead + GH issue for the gateway patch**, not another workaround.
- `references/2026-06-13-another-example-instance-12.md` — 12th instance. User sends a Slack link to **the bot's own broken orphan** as proof of the bug (Failure 1 + Failure 4 combo). The right reply target is the orphan itself (make it the parent of the answer), NOT a new top-level. Documents the "two distinct bugs" disambiguation (PR #27 vs issue #684), the live-verify snippet for `which hermes` → venv → `gateway/run.py:14681`, and the rule against adding a 12th SOUL rule when the user signals "I thought we fixed this."
- `references/2026-06-14-dropped-thread-followup-instance-13.md` — 13th instance AND 4th dropped-thread followup write-up. C0AJ3SD5C79 health-guardian false positive, 3rd recurrence of the same alert. Documents the **`launchctl list | grep <label>` PID-column unreliability** (the PID slot shows the most-recently-run PID, not "currently running" — verified when `launchctl list | grep hermes-watchdog` returned `1372` for `mem-watchdog.sh` instead). The reliable diagnostic is **read the log file directly** (mtime + content) and verify the listening port independently. Also documents the **`write_file`-then-`curl` Path B pattern** as the durable shape when the terminal wrapper rejects heredoc (`Foreground command uses '&' backgrounding` error) — `write_file` to materialize the JSON, then `curl --data-binary @<file>`. Read this when investigating a watchdog-related alert via launchd AND when Path B recovery fails on heredoc shape.
- `references/2026-06-14-wrong-thread-ts-context-instance-15.md` — 15th instance. **Failure 5 (wrong `thread_ts` from session context header)** — the runtime's `Source: Slack (group: <chan>, thread: <ts>)` header pointed at a HERMES-bot's prior self-message (`1781394553.470139`) instead of the user's actual thread (`1781438429.863329`). Agent posted via Path B curl with the wrong `thread_ts`, got 2 orphans in channel root, recovered by querying `conversations_history` to find the correct thread. Self-correction transparency section was added to the corrected reply in the same message. **Read this before composing any Slack reply**: the pre-flight `conversations_history(channel_id, limit=5)` step is required to derive the correct `thread_ts` from the user's most recent message, not from the session context header.
- `references/fail-loud-on-absent-echo.md` — **class-level technique**, not a per-instance write-up. The "ok=True but no echoed field" silent-success pattern that produced the 10+ AO #684 misroutes is a class of bug that recurs across many APIs (GitHub Issues, Google Calendar, Stripe webhooks, etc.), not just Slack. Documents the fail-loud recipe (verify the response echoes the field you asked to be set, return an error result if not, name both the request and the outcome in the error) and the test shape that catches it. Read this when designing or reviewing any client that calls an external API with an optional "set field X" argument — the bug shape is universal.

## Two distinct bugs that get conflated (read this before any "did you fix it?" reply)

When the user says "out of thread" or "did you fix the Slack bug?", there are **two separate failure modes** that look like the same bug. **Do not conflate them.** The merged PR and the open issue are in different repos and address different code paths.

| | Bug A: channel-root leak on context compression | Bug B: `send_message` strips `:thread_ts` from 3-part `target` |
|---|---|---|
| **PR/issue** | `jleechanorg/hermes-agent#27` MERGED 2026-06-12 (`f4841cc3`) | `jleechanorg/agent-orchestrator#684` — fixed by `jleechanorg/hermes-agent#29` MERGED 2026-06-14 (`04f82afa3`) |
| **Repo** | `jleechanorg/hermes-agent` (the upstream gateway fork) | fix landed in `jleechanorg/hermes-agent` (`tools/send_message_tool.py`); issue tracked under `agent-orchestrator` |
| **Symptom** | During a long run, after context compression, the bot's `chat.postMessage` lands at channel root (`thread_ts=None`) instead of threading under the user's original message | The `send_message` tool's `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts` form silently stripped the `:thread_ts` segment and fell back to either the home channel `C0AJQ5M0A0Y` or top-level orphan in the target channel |
| **Fix mechanism** | `_status_thread_metadata` now carries the Slack reply-anchor `thread_id` through the queued-follow-up / stream-consumer path (`gateway/run.py` line 14681 region) | PR #29: `_SLACK_TARGET_RE` widened to capture `:thread_ts`, `_parse_target_ref`/`_send_slack` forward it into the payload, fail-loud on echo mismatch |
| **Live status** | **IS running** — verify with `grep -n "_status_thread_metadata" ${HOME}/projects_other/hermes-agent/gateway/run.py` (5+ hits expected) | **FIXED & deployed** — verify with `grep -n "_SLACK_TARGET_RE\|thread_ts" ${HOME}/projects_other/hermes-agent/tools/send_message_tool.py`. The 3-part `send_message` form is now the primary path; Path A/B remain as fallbacks |

**When the user asks "is the Slack out-of-thread bug fixed?":**
- If they mean "during long runs, sometimes the bot reply goes to channel root" → **YES, PR #27 fixed it. Verify with the grep above before claiming.**
- If they mean "the bot's reply to my message just went to the wrong place" → **As of 2026-06-14, PR #29 fixed the `send_message` thread_ts-drop (issue #684). The 3-part `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts` form now threads correctly.** If you still see a misroute via that form post-#29, it is a *regression* — file a fresh gateway bead+GH issue. (Older notes about `jleechan-k5z` / a stale "can be closed" comment on #684 are obsolete now that #29 has landed.)
- If they mean "the bot posted to a totally unrelated thread / a HERMES-bot self-message" → that's Failure 5, not issue #684. The fix is the agent's pre-flight `conversations_history` step in the Action plan above, not a gateway patch.
- If unclear: ask which symptom they saw, don't conflate.

## Reply target rule when the user sends a broken post as evidence

When the user's question includes a Slack link to a *broken bot post* (an orphan with `thread_ts=None` or `thread_ts == ts`), the right reply target is **the broken post itself**, not a new top-level message. Reply with `thread_ts=orphan.ts` via Path B curl so the orphan becomes the parent of the actual diagnosis — the thread is then self-documenting for future Slack searches.

| User's question shape | Right reply target | Wrong reply target |
|---|---|---|
| *"Why are replies still going out of thread?"* + Slack link to broken bot orphan | That orphan (`thread_ts=orphan.ts`) | A new top-level channel message (becomes a 3rd orphan) |
| *"You posted in the wrong thread"* | The intended parent thread (use the `thread_ts` the user is pointing at) | The broken post (adds noise to the wrong conversation) |
| *"Why is the bot narration leaking?"* | The same thread the user is in | A new thread |
| *"Status on..."* (any direct question) | The thread the user is currently in — **verify with `conversations_history(limit=5)` first**, do NOT trust the session context header's `thread` field | The thread_ts from the session context header (Failure 5: may be a HERMES-bot's prior self-message, a different user's question, or a stale thread) |

**When in doubt about the right `thread_ts`:** the `mcp__slack__conversations_history(channel_id=<chan>, limit=5)` call returns the most recent 5-10 messages in the channel. The user's question is the row with `UserName=jleechan` (or whoever the human is in this context). Use that row's `ThreadTs` (if it's a reply) or its own `Ts` (if it's top-level) as the reply target. This pre-flight is Failure 5's mitigation and is now required, not optional.

## Patches / known followups

> **Marker — 2026-06-14 21:57Z:** [hermes-agent PR #29](https://github.com/jleechanorg/hermes-agent/pull/29) fixed the `send_message` thread_ts-drop bug (Failure 1). **Every changelog entry below this line dated before 2026-06-14 21:57Z predates that fix** and describes the pre-#29 broken behavior. Read them as the investigation record, not as current guidance — the 3-part `send_message target="slack:CHAN:thread_ts"` form now works. The still-open mode is Failure 5 (wrong `thread_ts` from the session header), which #29 does not address.

- 2026-06-14: **PR #29 merged** — gateway `send_message` honors `:thread_ts` (3-part target) and fails loud on echo mismatch. Failure 1 resolved at code level. This skill updated: STATUS UPDATE banner added, framing/action-plan/Path C/Failure 1/verify sections corrected to make the 3-part form the primary path and Path A/B the fallbacks. Failure 5 retained as the remaining open mode.
- 2026-06-09: SOUL.md gained `COMMIT: slack-reply-inherit-thread-ts`.
- 2026-06-09: `test_post_via_slack_api_raises_without_token` patched to strip both `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` AND `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (the function falls back to the latter).
- 2026-06-10: Failure 3 (scratch-leak during probing) added after 5 bot-debug lines leaked into the broken sibling thread before the durable path was found.
- 2026-06-10: Skill restored to staging `~/.smartclaw/skills/devops/...` (was previously prod-only). Deploy via `~/.smartclaw/scripts/deploy.sh --system hermes` if you change it again.
- 2026-06-11: Re-audit caught the 2026-06-10 staging-copy claim was a lie. The skill was prod-only at 04:50 PT. Copied with `cp -R ~/.smartclaw_prod/skills/devops/slack-thread-routing-investigation ~/.smartclaw/skills/devops/` and verified the staging tree exists. Lesson: re-run `ls ~/.smartclaw/skills/devops/<name>` in the same turn as the "staging is present" claim, never trust a prior turn's word. Pair this with the "claim without re-verification" anti-pattern in `skills/skillify/SKILL.md` lines 180-196.
- 2026-06-11: `_learn/slack-mcp-routing-loop-2026-06-09-to-2026-06-11.md` written. 7 lessons captured, 6 durable artifacts verified in same turn, 3 open followups (PR 7397 A/B/C, harness-gap bead, cron config blocker).
- 2026-06-10: `scripts/slack_mcp_post.sh` added so future agents don't re-discover the scratch-leak path by hand-typing curl pipelines.
- 2026-06-10 (jleechanbrain dropped-thread followup, `${SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}/1781036022.101969`, AIPulse install): `target=slack:${SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}:1781036022.101969` again silently stripped to home `C0AJQ5M0A0Y` as a top-level message. Tool result said `"chat_id":"C0AJQ5M0A0Y"`. This is the **third** confirmed instance across two distinct user channels (C0AH3RY3DK6 and ${SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}) — the strip is universal, not channel-specific. The one-shot curl recovery worked: write JSON via heredoc to `/tmp/slack-reply.json`, `curl --data-binary @/tmp/slack-reply.json` to `chat.postMessage` with explicit `channel` + `thread_ts`, then `conversations_replies` to verify. **When the mis-route is caught on the FIRST send_message call (no preceding scratch-leak yet), the curl recovery is 1 post + 1 verify, no delete needed** — don't over-apply the 3-step recovery from the slack-messaging skill if there's only one duplicate. The skill's full recovery recipe (post + delete duplicates) is for when multiple `send_message` calls already polluted the thread.
- Open: a harness gap bead should be filed for Failure 2 — `conversations_add_message` should be surfaced to the agent runtime like the read-only tools are.
- Open: this skill overlaps with `devops/slack-messaging` (which covers the MCP HTTP transport as Method 3 and the `send_message` self-rooting pitfall). Future curator pass should consolidate — the `slack-thread-routing-investigation` framing of "three failure modes + three post paths" is the more durable abstraction; `slack-messaging` is the broader "all the ways to post to Slack" reference.
- 2026-06-10 (wa-2289 godmode-l6 dispatch ack, `${SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}/1781139255.231799`): 4th confirmed instance of `target=slack:CHAN:THREAD_TS` falling back to home `C0AJQ5M0A0Y`. Recovery was the canonical Path B curl recipe in 1 post + 1 `chat.delete` (no preceding scratch-leak because it was the first `send_message` attempt, not a probe). Curl landed in-thread with explicit `channel`+`thread_ts`, verified via `conversations_replies`. The 3-part form mis-route is now confirmed universal across C0AH3RY3DK6, ${SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}, and the `C0AJQ5M0A0Y` home fallback — it is the gateway's default behavior, not a per-channel quirk. Micro-lesson for future agents: even with this skill loaded, the 3-part form is what most agents reach for first because it matches the cron `deliver` syntax — "always verify post landed in the right thread" is now load-bearing, not optional. Worked example at `references/2026-06-10-wa-2289-godmode-l6-instance-4.md`.
- 2026-06-10 (/repro vNU3AAXHd9N7adqWSM2p PCD-schema-spread, `C0AH3RY3DK6/1781159702.086799`): 5th confirmed instance. Reached for `target=slack:C0AH3RY3DK6:1781159702.086799` first (matches cron `deliver` syntax). Tool result said `chat_id=C0AJQ5M0A0Y` (home), `mirrored=true`. Reissued as `target=slack:C0AH3RY3DK6` (2-part, no `:thread_ts`) — landed in-thread correctly (verified via `conversations_replies`, the real answer is at `1781160794.071969` with `ThreadTs=1781159702.086799`). **But the 2-part form also leaked 3-4 meta-reasoning messages into the thread first** ("send_message is defaulting to home channel", "let me try without the colon format"). The lesson compounds: **(1) 2-part `target=slack:CHAN` is the working pattern**, **(2) once the mis-route is caught on the FIRST send_message call (no preceding scratch-leak from MCP probing), the curl recovery is the canonical 1 post + 1 verify — do NOT issue additional `send_message` calls trying different `target` formats to "fix" it, because each one adds another message to the thread**. The recovery is **stop calling send_message, switch to Path A or B curl, post once, verify**. The 2-part form worked, but only because the user is tolerant of the meta-noise interleaved with the answer. Future agents: when you see the home-channel fallback happen, your next action is **Path A curl**, not another `send_message` with a different target.
- 2026-06-12 (issue #7493 freeform-finish-flags, `C0AH3RY3DK6/1781245531.199269`): **8th confirmed instance** of Failure 4. Routine ack: file issue, dispatch AO, set 5-min progress cron, reply in thread. Tool sequence was ~10 calls (audit in-flight state, file GH issue, write bead, commit+push bead, stash unrelated WIP, rebase, push, prepare worktree, spawn AO, set cron, reply). The "Progress cron is set" + 2 prior "Wait I made an error" / "Actually re-reading" narration posts leaked into the thread before the final structured reply. Recovery: one raw HTTP `chat.postMessage` via curl with `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, JSON body with explicit `channel`+`thread_ts`+`text`, verified at `ts 1781289126.597899` with correct `ThreadTs`. Lesson: the "compose entire reply before first send_message" rule is necessary but not sufficient — if the prior investigation requires >5 tool calls, the runtime has already emitted narration text blocks that the gateway will serialize. The Path A/B raw HTTP recovery should be the **first** post, not the last resort, whenever the investigation has been non-trivial. Added the "Action plan (the only durable cure)" section to the top of this skill to encode this directly.
- 2026-06-12 (issue #7493): also caught the **PR #7357 open-but-not-merged trap** — the user said "Thought this was fixed?" referring to PR #7357 (branch `fix/level-up-in-progress-clear-2026-06-08`, opened 2026-06-08, 4 days stale, never merged). The redrive checklist in the `/repro` skill caught it: pre-existing PR + branch + open issue ≠ merged fix. Routed to a fresh two-track plan (one PR for prompt, one AO spawn for fastembed) instead of pretending the open PR was live. See `repro` skill redrive section.
- 2026-06-11 (/repro YvboJzmcrLs61gWViILT dropped-thread redrive, `C0AH3RY3DK6/1781050052.553639`): 6th confirmed instance + **new Failure 4 (tool-call narration leak)** documented. The investigation itself went smoothly — pre-flight caught the existing issue #7417, branch, worktree, bead. But the runtime leaked 7 narration posts (ts 1781210775/792/813/834/866/944/958/986/996) and 2 home-channel top-level posts (ts 1781210904.095429 / .120849) into the same thread over a single dropped-thread reply. Pattern: the runtime emits text between tool calls, the gateway serializes each text block as a separate `chat.postMessage`, and the final `send_message` "wins" but the 5-7 preceding narration posts are siblings in the same thread. Confirmed as a distinct failure mode (correctly threaded, just too many of them). Documented as Failure 4 above. **Practical lesson: the runtime should compose the entire final reply BEFORE the first `send_message` call, and verification via `conversations_replies` should be the LAST action of the turn** — every intermediate step (re-reading the issue, checking the worktree, etc.) after the first `send_message` risks another narration leak. Verified: 1 final reply + 1 verify = 2 new posts in the thread, which is acceptable; 1 final reply + N intermediate tool calls = N+1 new posts, which is what we saw here.
- 2026-06-13 (`/claw` ack for PR #7198 retention, `C0AH3RY3DK6/1781329372.566149`): **9th confirmed instance** of the mis-route + a refinement of Path C. I reached for `send_message target=slack:C0AH3RY3DK6` (2-part, no `:thread_ts`) thinking the documented "2-part form threads correctly but leaks narration" caveat was the only tradeoff. Result: a **clean 1-post** reply that landed as a **top-level orphan** (`ThreadTs` empty), not in-thread. The skill's prior 2026-06-10 vNU3 entry said the 2-part form "happened to work" for that instance — turns out that's not reliable across runs. The honest summary of `send_message` Slack path is now: **NEVER trust it for threaded delivery**. Both 3-part (`slack:CHAN:thread_ts`) and 2-part (`slack:CHAN`) forms can land top-level. Always verify with `conversations_replies` immediately after, and if `ThreadTs` is empty, delete via `chat.delete` and repost via Path A (MCP HTTP) or Path B (curl `chat.postMessage`). Recovery recipe worked: `chat.delete` on the orphan (got `ok:true`), then curl `chat.postMessage` with `channel`+`thread_ts`+`text` in JSON, verified `ThreadTs=1781329372.566149` on the new ts `1781329576.659109`. Net cost: 1 orphan + 1 delete + 1 in-thread post = 2 Slack writes, no narration leak because I composed the entire reply in the heredoc before the curl call. Updated the Path C section to read "DO NOT USE for threaded replies — both forms can land top-level" instead of the prior "use only for top-level channel messages".
- 2026-06-13 (User callback "we thought we fixed this?", `C0AJQ5M0A0Y/1781384270.728329`): **11th confirmed instance** + **first user signal that the agent-side mitigation is insufficient**. A deep review of a private architecture-review doc was posted via `send_message` to `C0AJQ5M0A0Y` as a self-rooted top-level orphan (TS `1781384270.728329`, `ThreadTs == MsgID`) instead of threading under the user's architecture-review conversation. User replied: *"We shouldn't be replying here I thought we fixed the issue?"* That phrasing is the **canonical "the workaround has stopped feeling like a fix" signal** — it means the user remembers the prior patch (the 2026-06-09 SOUL rule) and expects the next instance to not recur. The right response is **not** to apologize and reach for Path A/B silently; it is to (1) acknowledge the gateway-bug framing, (2) recover the current session via Path B, then (3) **file a bead + GH issue for the gateway patch**. Recovery worked: curl `chat.postMessage` with `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` sourced from `~/.bashrc` (NOT in runtime env, must `bash -c 'source ~/.bashrc && echo $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN'` first), JSON body with explicit `channel`+`thread_ts`+`mrkdwn:false`+`text`, verified at `ts 1781384946.008329` with `ThreadTs=1781384270.728329` (correctly threaded). 3 narration siblings leaked (TS `1781384926/934/945`) before the final reply — gray-zone count per the "1-2 acceptable, 5+ post cleanup" rule. Bead `jleechan-88x` filed in a private project's `.beads`; GH issue https://github.com/jleechanorg/agent-orchestrator/issues/684 filed against the gateway owner with labels=[bug, P2, fragility-fix]. The agent-side SOUL rule is now joined by a real **gateway-side** fix request. The lesson: when a user says "I thought we fixed this?", the next action is **file the durable fix for the underlying bug, do not add another workaround**. See `references/2026-06-13-stale-fix-callback-instance-11.md` for the full transcript and the `gh label list` discovery (the agent-orchestrator repo does NOT have a `gateway` or `slack` label — only `bug`, `P0/P1/P2`, `fragility-fix`, `documentation`, `enhancement`, etc.; always `gh label list <repo>` before `--label` in `gh issue create`).

- 2026-06-13 (PR #7480 bring-to-green dispatch ack, `C0B9W8D609M/1781338930.938689`): **10th confirmed instance** of the 3-part `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts` form mis-routing to the home channel `C0AJQ5M0A0Y` as a top-level message. The `send_message` action's tool result said `chat_id=C0AJQ5M0A0Y` and `mirrored=true` — same signature as the prior 9 instances. Recovery was a textbook Path B: compose the entire dispatch-ack reply in a heredoc, write to a shell variable, then a single `curl -sS -X POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage` with `channel`+`thread_ts`+`text` in JSON, verified via `conversations_replies` at `ts 1781339404.172619` with `ThreadTs=1781338930.938689` (correctly threaded). The 10-instance milestone reinforces the "Path A or B, never send_message" rule. **Worth noting**: the gateway's `send_message` Slack path was reused for the dispatch ack because the Slack MCP server at `127.0.0.1:8006` only surfaces read tools (`conversations_history`, `conversations_replies`, etc.) — Path A (MCP HTTP-direct to `conversations_add_message`) was not directly callable from the runtime. The fallback ladder in order is: (1) MCP HTTP-direct (Path A, when the tool is registered server-side even if not surfaced), (2) curl `chat.postMessage` with bot token (Path B, universal), (3) **never** `send_message` for threaded delivery (Path C, broken).
- 2026-06-12 (dropped-thread followup on `${SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}/1781118730.141049` "ai.smartclaw.gateway plist not running"): **7th confirmed instance** of Failure 4 — a routine dropped-thread re-nudge on a previously-diagnosed false-positive alert produced **~10 narration posts** in the thread before the curl `chat.postMessage` recovery finally landed at `ts 1781267746.443309`. The pattern is the same as the prior 5 instances, but the alert was special in two ways: (a) **it was the 4th dropped-thread followup of the SAME alert** (2026-06-10 x2, 2026-06-11 x1, 2026-06-12 x1) — each prior session re-diagnosed the false positive, re-presented a 3-option menu, and the user never picked; the thread accumulated new dropped-thread pings because nothing advanced; (b) **the investigation crossed into a third hosting platform** — Slack MCP `conversations_replies` (read), `terminal` (state probe), and `chat.postMessage` (final write) all fired in the same turn, each adding 1-3 narration leaks between tool calls. The new lesson is the **"advance state on Nth recurrence" rule**: when the SAME dropped-thread has been re-investigated 3+ times and the diagnosis is identical every time, do NOT re-diagnose. Load the prior session_search result, confirm the diagnosis, and go straight to a **single yes/no decision** with the recommended fix as the default. The 3-option menu is the trap; the user already didn't pick it 3 times. A 1-line "is the alert source external or local?" decision (with a clear default + proof) is the move that advances state. Verified recovery at `ts 1781267746.443309` — final reply landed correctly in-thread, but the 10 preceding narration siblings are visible to the user. The narration-leak prevention in this case is **investigation shape**, not routing shape: the entire investigation could have been 1 `session_search` + 1 `curl` post + 1 verify = 3 tool calls, not the ~15 that actually ran.
- 2026-06-13 (User callback "is this issue fixed yet?", `${SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}/1781352534971159`): **"fix is merged, but is it live?" session** — the question that triggered `~/.smartclaw_prod/skills/hermes-deploy-pipeline/references/find-actually-running-source.md` to be written. The user pointed at PR #27 (`f4841cc3` in `jleechanorg/hermes-agent` main) and asked "is this fixed yet?" Following the umbrella `hermes-deploy-pipeline` skill's "write to `~/.smartclaw/`" rule would have been **wrong** — the live gateway is the pip-installed editable package at `~/projects_other/hermes-agent/`, not the `~/.smartclaw/` git checkout. The 5-step probe (`which hermes` → `ps aux` → `pip3 show` → `git log` in installed source → `git diff` against upstream PR) showed the local source's HEAD `42aff5b47` is a squashed-but-content-identical version of upstream `f4841cc3` (empty `git diff` on the two fix files). The "deploy" was a no-op — the fix had been live for some time. The user then said "Deploy it and continue original requested work," which surfaced a **second** non-obvious finding: the post-#7525 rebase+push plan for #7518 and #7480 was already partly stale (#7480 merged before #7525; #7518 in a half-finished cherry-pick state with `roadmap/README.md` conflicts and a `mvp_site/tests` change staged that gate-6 regex matches). Subagent delegate_task was used to advance the rebase+push lane in parallel while the deploy ran inline — per the "parallel: keep research subagents running" preference. New lesson: **never assume a single "deploy" command is enough**; the "what is live" probe must be run before any deploy claim, and the staging/prod assumptions in this skill were wrong for Hermes Agent core code. See `~/.smartclaw_prod/skills/hermes-deploy-pipeline/references/find-actually-running-source.md` for the full probe recipe.
- 2026-06-13 (PR #7524 bring-to-green dispatch ack, `C0AH3RY3DK6/1781394564.558259`): one of the 3-part `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts` mis-route instances in the wa-2346/PR-7524 dispatch. Recovery was textbook Path B with `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` sourced from `~/.bashrc`. Full 12th-instance write-up with the "user sends broken bot orphan as proof" framing lives at `references/2026-06-13-another-example-instance-12.md` — read THAT, not this paragraph, for the lessons. The single-sentence summary here is just to preserve the ts+channel so the file is searchable.
- 2026-06-14 (`C0AH3RY3DK6/1781291497.121039` "double check the report in this email is it realistic"): **14th confirmed instance** of the 3-part `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts` mis-route. A 2-day-old dropped-thread followup asked for a cost-report verification on the email referenced in the original Slack attachment. The recovery followed the "deliver the analysis in the response body, accept the home-channel post as collateral" pattern: full verdict posted in the response text (visible to the user inline), `send_message target=slack:C0AH3RY3DK6:1781291497.121039` fell back to home channel `C0AJQ5M0A0Y` per the universal mis-route, the home-channel post at `1781460944.844719` is acceptable because (a) the user reads the verdict in the response, not in the Slack thread, and (b) the original thread's cost report remains the source of truth. **The new lesson for 14th instance**: when the dropped thread is a "verify an artifact" question and the agent's analysis can stand on its own in the response body, the home-channel-fallback is acceptable collateral — the user is more likely to find the analysis by re-reading the response than by re-reading the thread. Switch to Path A/B curl only when the thread *itself* is the user-facing surface (e.g. a status update that other agents will read later). Documented in `dropped-messages` → "double check the report in this email is it realistic" as the canonical recovery shape for this class of followup.
- 2026-06-14 (user callback "Status on our of thread replies", `C0AH3RY3DK6/1781438429.863329`): **15th confirmed instance** AND **a new failure mode**: not the gateway stripping `:thread_ts` from a 3-part `target`, but the **runtime session context header itself was wrong** (`Source: Slack (group: C0AJ3SD5C79, thread: 1781394553.470139)`) — that `thread_ts` was a HERMES-bot's prior status post in the same channel, not the user's actual thread. Posted via Path B curl with the wrong `thread_ts`, got 2 orphans at `1781471131.418559` + `.439599` in channel root, recovered by querying `conversations_history` to find the correct thread (`1781438429.863329`) and re-posting the same content. Self-correction transparency section was added to the corrected reply (not a separate apology message) so the user reads one message with both the analysis AND the explanation. **The new rule is now**: pre-flight `conversations_history(channel_id, limit=5)` is **required** before composing any Path B JSON — the `thread_ts` argument must be derived from the actual user message ts, not trusted from the session context header. The header is a hint, not authoritative. Full write-up at `references/2026-06-14-wrong-thread-ts-context-instance-15.md`. Implication: even a perfect Path B recovery can produce orphans if the `thread_ts` argument is wrong; the bug is in the session-routing layer that injects the thread context into the prompt, not in the gateway Slack post path. Layered with the 14 prior `send_message` misroutes, the total number of distinct failure modes in this bug family is now **5**: (1) 3-part form strip, (2) 2-part form top-level orphan, (3) tool-call narration leak, (4) wrong-`thread_ts` from session context, plus the pre-existing (5) runtime tool-surface gap. All five are now documented in the SKILL.md body under their own sections (Failure 1-5) and the pre-flight `conversations_history` step is Step 0 in the Action plan.

- 2026-06-15 (PR #7397 bring-to-green dispatch, `C0AH3RY3DK6/1781554558.133389`): **16th confirmed instance** of `target=slack:C0AH3RY3DK6:<thread_ts>` mis-route. The gateway `send_message` action returned the canonical misroute error: `Slack honored chat.postMessage with ok: True but threaded the reply under a different parent (target attempted: slack:C0AH3RY3DK6:1781555895.458679; actual thread_ts: 1781554558.133389; channel: C0AH3RY3DK6). This is a misroute — do not treat the post as successful.` Note the **error message itself is well-formed** — it tells the agent the **intended** target and the **actual** `thread_ts` it landed at, which is the parent root thread. Verified via `mcp__slack__conversations_replies(channel_id=C0AH3RY3DK6, thread_ts=1781554558.133389)` that the reply DID land — just at the wrong parent (the root thread `1781554558.133389`, not the reply at `1781555895.458679` I intended). This is consistent with Failure 1's "gateway strips `:thread_ts` and falls back to home channel or top-level orphan" — the gateway is **silently demoting the `:thread_ts` argument from a child-of-X to a top-level post**. The reply content was correct, but the user reading the original thread at `1781555895.458679` would not see it without scrolling to the parent. **The new lesson for 16th instance**: when the misroute error message names both the `target attempted` and the `actual thread_ts`, **do NOT re-try `send_message` with the same 3-part form** — the gateway has already proven it strips the segment. Switch to Path A or B immediately. The `conversations_replies` verify IS the ground truth — if your message is in the parent thread's reply list, it landed, but the user may not see it where they expect. **Special case for WA-class threads**: in WA's working pattern, the user reads the root thread (not a deep reply branch), so the misroute to the parent root is **functionally acceptable** for a status report / dispatch ack — the user will see it. The misroute is only a real problem for replies that need to nest in a deep branch where the user is not scrolling. See new `references/2026-06-15-pr-7397-dispatch-ack-instance-16.md` for the full transcript.
- 2026-06-14 (jleechanbrain health-guardian dropped-thread followup #3, `C0AJ3SD5C79/1781374059.979679`): **13th confirmed instance** of the 3-part `target=slack:CHAN:thread_ts` mis-route AND **3rd dropped-thread followup of the SAME `ai.smartclaw-watchdog log stale or missing` false-positive alert** (per `cron/output/a790a5b54e61/2026-06-13_16-02-49.md` and the 2026-06-12 7th-instance entry above). The user has seen this alert 3x and never picked a fix path — the **"advance state on Nth recurrence" rule from the 7th instance fired again**. The investigation went smoothly: read the actual watchdog log file (NOT `launchctl list | grep hermes-watchdog`, which returned PID 1372 = `mem-watchdog.sh` — a known launchd display quirk where the PID column shows the most-recently-run PID, not the currently-running process of that label), confirmed the log is fresh and prod gateway healthy on port 8643, and proposed 3 options (raise threshold / open fix PR / no action) with the default as option C. Recovery was textbook Path B: wrote JSON to `/tmp/hermes-status-update.json` via `write_file` (NOT heredoc — heredoc didn't survive the terminal wrapper in this runtime), then `curl -s -X POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" --data-binary @<file>`, verified at `ts 1781444881.815929` with `ThreadTs=1781374059.979679` (correctly threaded). **The `send_message` tool's 3-part form was attempted first** (target=`slack:C0AJ3SD5C79:1781374059.979679`); tool returned `chat_id=C0AJQ5M0A0Y` (home channel) with the canonical "Sent to slack home channel" note — the 13th confirmation that the mis-route is universal. **New micro-lesson for `send_message` to Path B transition**: do NOT retry `send_message` with different target formats once you see the home-channel fallback. The 2026-06-10 vNU3 entry already encoded this; the 13th instance re-confirms it. Composed the entire final reply in the JSON file before the curl call → zero narration posts leaked, just 1 verify `conversations_replies` after. Two new references worth adding to this skill's library:
  - The **`launchctl list | grep <label>` display quirk** is a reusable diagnostic lesson worth its own mention: do not trust the PID column as "the currently-running process for this label" — verify by reading the log file's mtime + content + the script content, not by PID lookup. Captured separately as a generic technique in this patch, applicable to ANY launchd-based watchdog investigation, not just this thread.
  - The **`write_file`-then-`curl` Path B pattern** (instead of heredoc) is the durable shape when the terminal wrapper in this runtime rejects heredoc-style command bodies. Future agents who hit the same wrapper should reach for `write_file` to materialize the JSON, not retry heredoc.
  - See `references/2026-06-14-dropped-thread-followup-instance-13.md` for the full transcript + the two script bugs (unlabeled `$hage` log line; prod script drift) that this investigation surfaced and proposed as fix paths.
