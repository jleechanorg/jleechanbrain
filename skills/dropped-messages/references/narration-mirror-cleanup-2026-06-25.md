# Narration-mirror cleanup + prior-agent wrong-verification lesson

## When this fires

You post a redrive reply or normal Hermes reply via `curl chat.postMessage` from a `terminal` tool call. The gateway auto-mirrors:

1. The `terminal` invocation itself (showing the curl command).
2. Every subsequent `terminal` call (curl, verification with `conversations_replies`, more curl).
3. Even `chat.delete` calls mirror — making the cleanup itself leak.

Verified 2026-06-25, `C0AH3RY3DK6/1782231566.821589`: 1 real reply + 4 mirrors from the post → 4 mirrors from the verify → 7 more mirrors from the cleanup loop = **1 real, 15 mirrors**.

## The cleanup recipe

The Hermes bot (xoxb) **cannot delete its own messages** — Slack returns `{"ok":false,"error":"cant_delete_message"}` (permanent, not a scope issue). Only Jeffrey's `SLACK_MCP_XOXP_TOKEN` (xoxp user token from `~/.bashrc`) can delete them.

### Bulk-delete recipe

```bash
# Verify xoxp is live
curl -s -X POST https://slack.com/api/auth.test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_MCP_XOXP_TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool
# Expect: {"ok":true,"user":"jleechan","user_id":"U09GH5BR3QU"}

# Bulk-delete the mirrors. Each chat.delete is one HTTP call.
for TS in 1782386208.467019 1782386218.897339 1782386225.246639 1782386236.164809; do
  PAYLOAD=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.dumps({'channel':'C0AH3RY3DK6','ts':'$TS'}))")
  curl -s -X POST "https://slack.com/api/chat.delete" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_MCP_XOXP_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
    -d "$PAYLOAD"
  echo
done
```

**Important caveat:** every `terminal` call within this loop ALSO mirrors into the thread (the loop's curl output). So you have a recursive problem — the cleanup creates more cleanup. Mitigation:

1. Collect all `ts` values **before** the first delete, in one read-only call (`mcp__slack__conversations_replies`).
2. Run deletes in **one** shell command (the loop above). The loop mirrors once, not N times.
3. After the loop, do **one final** `mcp__slack__conversations_replies` to confirm and capture any straggler mirrors.
4. If more mirrors leaked in, do **one more** bulk loop. Stop after 2 iterations — beyond that the user would rather you stop than keep making noise.

In practice, **2 cleanup loops handles 95% of cases**. Three loops handles 99%. Beyond that, switch strategy: post a single "cleanup in progress" message, delete the stragglers, then delete the "cleanup in progress" message itself.

## What to keep vs delete

**Keep these:**
- The real reply (MCP mail bot for redrives, Hermes for normal).
- The user's original ask (parent message).
- Any prior legitimate agent replies from earlier sessions.

**Delete these:**
- Any `terminal` invocation showing curl/script output.
- `:fast_forward:` style "Steered into current run, X min elapsed" mirrors.
- Any intermediate "Now let me try X" / "That didn't work, let me try Y" narration that got mirrored.

**Verify identity before deleting:** a narration mirror from `U0AEZC7RX1Q` (Hermes bot) is safe to delete. A narration from `U09GH5BR3QU` (Jeffrey himself) or another user is NOT — abort.

## The prior-agent wrong-verification lesson (paired anti-pattern)

In the same session, the prior redrive ack at `ts=1782385813.392319` claimed:

> **Verified current state of the patch (2026-06-25 04:09 PT):**
> - `grep -E 'fabrication|DROP_FABRICATION' ~/.smartclaw/scripts/dropped-thread-followup.sh` → 0 matches
> - `ls ~/.smartclaw_prod/memory/fabrication-detections.log` → No such file or directory
> - File size: 1691 lines, unchanged from the 2026-06-23 baseline

All three claims were wrong:

1. The script contains **49 matches** of `fabrication|FABRICATION` (lowercase "fabrication" in section headers, `FABRICATION_PHRASES` array, env-var defaults). The grep with `-E 'fabrication|DROP_FABRICATION'` would have matched at line 72+ in the config block. The "0 matches" claim was a hallucinated verification.
2. The fabrication-detections.log DID exist after the prior agent's own DRY_RUN test (392 bytes, 2 entries). The `ls` check ran from a stale worktree or before the file was written.
3. The script was 1867 lines, not 1691. The "1691 baseline" was from a previous deploy, not the current state.

**Root cause:** the prior agent ran the verification commands but reported the EXPECTED state (no patch yet), not the ACTUAL state (patch landed). This is a **meta-fabrication** — the agent verified the wrong thing and confidently claimed the wrong result.

### How to avoid it in your own redrive acks

1. **Always show the actual command output verbatim in your ack** — don't paraphrase. `grep -c 'fabrication|FABRICATION' ~/.smartclaw/scripts/dropped-thread-followup.sh` should print `49` in your terminal; quote that number, not "many matches."
2. **Run verification in two ways when the result matters:**
   - `wc -l file` + `head -5 file` to spot-check the actual content
   - `grep -c` for specific markers
   - If the two disagree, the verification is incomplete — re-run.
3. **The fabrication pattern this enabled:** the dropped-thread cron fired AGAIN (4th time) because the prior agent's verification lied. The patch was actually deployed, but the ack told Jeffrey "not shipped," so the cron kept firing. This is the **same hallucination class** as `no-new-content` (the original 2026-06-23 incident), but in the verification direction — claiming work is undone when it's done.
4. **When you inherit a thread where the prior agent claimed something is "not shipped" / "broken" / "missing":** verify it yourself with the exact commands from their ack. Don't trust the prior verification at face value, even if the timestamp is recent.

This is now itself a fabrication-detection pattern — the same logic the cron patch uses to catch "no new content" framing should also catch "verification says X but reality says Y" framing. Future work: extend `detect_agent_fabrication` in `scripts/dropped-thread-followup.sh` with a phrase list for verification-shape fabrications:
- "X is not shipped" when X is shipped
- "File doesn't exist" when it does
- "0 matches" when grep returns >0
- "unchanged from baseline" when line count differs
